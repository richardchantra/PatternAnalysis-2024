### Problem Statement

- Melanomas are responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths, it is estimated around 7,000 people die annually from the disease.
- Using computer vision techniques we can improve diagnosis of melanoma by assisting dermatologists thus improving diagnostic accuracy.
- The data we are using comes from International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) and is referred to as the ISIC-2020 Dataset.
- It is the largest publicly available collection of dematologically-QC skin lesions.
- The task is to classify melanomas with 0.8 accuracy for the test set.
- We will be implementing a Siamese Network

### Preprocessing

### Siamese Networks

- First implemented by Taigman et al., 2014. in DeepFace: Closing the Gap to Human-Level Performance in Face Verification


### Siamese Network Architecture
